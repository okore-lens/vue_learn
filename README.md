# Vue Learning

## Basics

### Computed vs Methods

What useEffect is to react is what computed is to Vue.
Computed runs once and while a method called runs everytime the component/view is rerendered

### Conditional Rendering

Conditional Rendering Of Vue (v-if="some condition"), and yes you guessed it right you can also use (v-else-if, v-else and surprisingly evene v-show)

### Watchers

Functions in watch are triggered everytime a reactive property changes
